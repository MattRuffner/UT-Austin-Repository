    "One example of right problem that had already been solved but was irreproducible was when a business analyst at a finance company created a monthly report using simpler steps and software, and later realized that essentially the exact same results could have been obtained from using AutoCAD. However, when attempting to follow the procedure for the AutoCAD process, he realized that the procedure was flawed: he could not reproduce the right results. In other words, it turned out that he found a better solution to a problem that previously had an incorrectly documented and possibly outdated process.\n",

    "An example of solving the right problem in the wrong way would be using a robust but low-explainability predictive model to decide on a course of action, when the task is really to develop a model that is intuitive enough to convince managers and non-data-scientists to adopt it. The \"correct answer\" is technically achieved, but the true goal of mass usability is not.\n"

    "The variables associated with the individual Beta terms in our regression equation can vary to a great degree.  This is an issue as our tuning parameters will attempt to zero out the lower valued variables (regradless of whether or not they are the more important variables to our model) first while larger valued variables survive longer. For example, if we were building a model that considered an elephant's weight and lifetime, the variable associated with the weight parameter might have a magnitude of 60 while the variable associated with the lifetime parameter might have a magnitude of 10. In this scenario, lets say we know the lifetime parameter is of much more importance to the model than the weight parameter but when we regularize, the lifetime would be zeroed out before the weight parameter.

    "When the tuning parameter is sufficiently large, the lasso regularization yields more sparse models. The ridge model will never actually zero out any parameters even with a large tuning parameter, so after regularization you are still left with all the parameters. On the other hand, the sharp corners of the contour of the squared error loss given by the lasso model allows some of the parameters to be zeroed out. Along with more simplicity of interpretation, lasso being more sparse also makes the model more desireable by essentially performing variable selection for us."
